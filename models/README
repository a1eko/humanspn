Optimizing SPN models using mouse electrophysiology and human
morphological reconstructions.

Single-cell models are optimised using BluePyOpt on a
supercomputer. Values of the optimised free parameters are returned in
'best_models.json' file for best scoring models (n=10). Jupyter notebook
'select.ipynb' is used to manually select models for a release, stored
in 'hall_of_fame.json' file (n<=10). Release model is always #0 in the
hall_of_fame file. Other models can also be accepted after validation
against average features of the population of cells. Script 'variate.py'
(or 'pvariate.sh' for parallel multithread execution) is used to try
different combinations of optimised electrophysiological parameters and
morphological reconstructions (or modifications of the morphology used
for optimisation). Returns ephys features of the model combinations in
'var_models.json'. Script 'validate.py' is used to validate the models
against the population features; returns 'val_models.json'. For further
sanity check, a visual inspection of the plots of the model responses
is used.
