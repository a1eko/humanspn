These are SPN cells (dendritic arbors) from the mouse caudoputamen that
were intrarcellularly injected. Reconstructions animal_* and mouse_* are
from D1 type medium spiny neurons of 2 months old mice: they were first
retrogradely labeled by injections of fluorogold in the SN, and thereafter
injected with Lucifer Yellow in the striatum. Newer data C57_* from MSNs
(D1 or D2, without use of any tracer to label specific subpopulations)
of 6 months old mice includes spine density measurements.

Sections are mounted in glycerol 50%. No shrinkage correction factor is
needed.
